I am a skilled MERN stack developer with expertise in building dynamic and responsive web applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I specialize in front-end development with React, leveraging state management tools like Redux and Context API, and creating user-friendly interfaces with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.
On the back-end, I develop scalable APIs and server-side logic with Node.js and Express, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for efficient database management. I have hands-on experience in RESTful API integration, authentication using JWT.
I excel in collaborative environments, adapt quickly to new technologies, and am committed to delivering high-quality, optimized solutions that meet business goals.
